# Python Classes and Objects
# In the last tutorial, we learned about Python OOP. 
# We know that Python also supports the concept of objects and classes.

# An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions). 
# Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.

# Before we learn about objects, let's first learn about classes in Python.

# Python Classes
# A class is considered a blueprint of objects.

# We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. 
# It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc.

# Based on these descriptions, we build the house; the house is the object.

# Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.


# Define Python Class
# We use the class keyword to create a class in Python. For example,

class ClassName:
    # class definition
    pass

class Bike:
    name = ""
    gear = 0

    #Here,

#Bike - the name of the class
#name/gear - variables inside the class with default values "" and 0 respectively


#Note: The variables inside a class are called attributes.
